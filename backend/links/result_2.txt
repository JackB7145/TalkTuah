I think vocally, Sabrina Carpenter is better, probably due to her focus on training at a younger age, while Taylor Swift is a better songwriter and wordsmith, but you can definitely tell her vocals have also gotten better over the years as she’s done more training herself. But Sabrina was a better singer at a younger age. I think their focus in music was on different aspects of it and that’s all.
