They are great companions, very loyal, obviously friendly, I could go on and on. But there really is something about cats that just sets them above dogs. Also, to the dog lovers that say they haven’t “met a nice cat yet,” you are either the problem or you just haven’t tried hard enough. Cats have so much love to give, they just need some time to warm up to you. So, in this article I’ll be listing 5 reasons why I believe cats are better than dogs. Don’t worry, I have more, but I’m sparing your attention span. Be ready to throw away your sense of pride that you have for your beloved dogs. It’s now time to see the truth of this never ending debate. #1: Cats are wayyy more convenient than dogs Cats are very easy animals to take care of. Dogs on the other hand, need to play almost constantly, have to go on walks every day, bite and tear things that aren’t theirs to play with. You may be thinking, don’t cat’s claw on things and scratch as well? I don’t know about you, but I’d rather have claw marks on objects rather than actual tears or the object being destroyed. I would say the most inconvenient thing about cats is it’s the humans job to clean after their litter box. Which still makes them better than dogs—dog owners have to walk their dogs every single day. Cats are great animals to have because most of them can stay indoors without throwing a fit. #2: Dogs can get a little too excited over things. Dogs get too excited about is greeting humans. Although it can be endearing when a dog jumps on you to say hello, it can get quite annoying after a while. I have countless memories of sleeping over at friends houses where their dogs would wake us up at the crack of dawn. A cat would never. And if a cat would, it would be in a calm and peaceful manner, not in the rushing and ecstatic way that a dog would. #3: Dog attacks are way more violent than cat attacks. 4.5 million dog bites occur in the United States every year while 400,000 cat bites occur. Since dogs can bite more aggressively than cats and can bite repeatedly, this makes them a more dangerous animal. Fun fact, deaths attributed to pet bites pretty much exclusively involve dogs, not cats or any other animal. Cats tend to get a bad rap for their ability to scratch people, but 9 times out of 10, it’s because the person went too far or the cat is just not ready to get up close and personal with you. I feel like this is one of the main reasons why people prefer dogs over cats. But to me, this is a huge reason why they’re so loveable. Most cats will open up to you with time. It’s like when you’re trying to get close with a friend and they keep shutting down, but one day they finally open up to you. Cats do the same thing! #4: Ever heard a cat purr? It’s a phenomenal sound; I don’t even know how dogs can compete with that. Purring has also been said to have therapeutic capabilities for human muscles and bones. That being said, I would much rather hear a cat purr than a dog pant. I do have to admit it’s very cute when a dog wags its tail. Another fun fact: cats communicate that they love humans by slowly blinking at them. As a cat owner, this really makes you feel very special. I would argue that this feeling is much better than a dog licking your face in order to show you love. But to each their own. #5: Cats can give humans health benefits? Oh yes, you read that correctly. Cats have been proven to lower stress and anxiety for humans. They also reduce loneliness due to their great companionship. Going back to purring, scientific evidence shows that a cat’s purr can lower your blood pressure and calm your nervous system. Cat owners have been reported to have a lower risk for heart disease and stroke as well. I’m not saying dogs don’t have their own benefits, but I think it’s pretty clear cats come on top with this one. Well that was a lot of fun, I hope you learned something new about cats and I hope I may have swayed your opinion of them just slightly. If you have any rebuttals type away in the comment section, I’d love to see them. Hope I didn’t offend dog lovers that much and I hope you enjoyed this article.

The cons are that if you live in the country-side and have a garden for your cat to be in, they often bring back dead animals and it just stinks. Also, you need to pick up the cat’s poo from the litterbox which is disgusting. Moreover, they go missing a lot, chew on plants, and scratch things everywhere and you can’t really train them not to because it’s much more difficult than training a dog.

If you are more energetic and open to everyone, a dog is your best bet. If you are more quieter and just want to have some space, cats are the one for you.

You do have a point about dogs biting objects around the house, but this can be solved by training them (Which is not a bad thing) and purchasing dog toys for them to chew on. Also, taking your dog outside isn’t something that should be bothersome for the owner, and it’s not much of a hassle either ways. It also allows you to get a good workout in if your dog is up for it. You also do have a point about dog attacks being more violent than cat attacks. But I see this as dogs being better protectors than cats. It is a shame that many street dogs are violent though. There are also many violent household dogs, but this could be because of their territorial aggression. You could train your dog to be less aggressive which is very difficult, but possible.

Mainly, if you’re not the type of person to open up easily and needs some company, cats are much better to spend around and make you feel extremely special with just a purr and nuzzling. Thank you so much for your argument, this really helped a lot!

They take you outdoors which makes you curious; that also leads you to feeling more free from the inside. That’s why dogs are better.
