This is an argument that has been going on for as long as people started keeping pets. Pet owners being asked to choose a side, pick a species, identify themselves as either cat or dog people. Although there are many out there in my position, lucky enough to share their lives with both cats and dogs, people who claim not to have a favorite are being as honest as parents who say they don’t have a favorite child – come on! You might assume from the title that I have declared myself a ‘cat person’, but you might want to wait until you’ve read Part Two: Why Dogs Are Better Than Cats before you decide. And no, I’m not going to tell you which I am – spoilers! Instead, I present to you a (relatively) unbiased argument for the affirmative team on why cats are better than dogs. Cats Are Better Than Dogs Because… They are quite self-sufficient and relatively low-maintenance They are practically born toilet-trained They don’t need to be taken out for walks They don’t bark They don’t jump up on your guests They don’t hump your furniture, your leg, your guest’s leg… They can be left alone for long periods of time (even overnight if you have planned and prepared appropriately) Their purring releases endorphins in them and us They are emotionally intelligent They keep themselves clean They have evolved a form of communication (the meow) specifically for humans Kittens are undeniably, unquestionably, adorable Cats are definitely more relaxed companions. Of course, living with cats isn’t all hugs and rainbows, and there can be some negatives (or perceived negatives) to life in the company of felinekind. For instance: They can somehow make us feel judged, unwanted, or surplus to requirement They leave hair on EVERYTHING They leave claw marks on clothing, carpets, and furniture They bring us gifts we don’t want (eg. dead – or almost dead – mice, birds, rats etc) They can be aloof – affection is usually on their terms only They sometimes express stress, irritation, territorialism, or dissatisfaction by peeing on things They vomit They are often most active between 12am and 3am It can be challenging to keep indoor cats in, and outdoor cats out They can cause conflict between neighbors if they use their garden as a litter box Ned the Chihuahua vs the Cats. Who Identifies As A Cat Person? I have long believed that even people without pets can be categorized as cat or dog people, though there will always be exceptions and outliers. Broadly speaking, a cat person tends to be someone who : is more introvert than extrovert is wary of strangers doesn’t make friends easily, but makes them for life prefers the comforts of home likes to re-read favorite books and re-watch favorite movies and tv shows is cautious, reflective, and considers things carefully prefers a warm spot in a cool home, rather than central heating will turn on a fan or air-conditioner to be able to stay under a blanket likes (and may even have) dogs, but doesn’t have a close affinity with them prefers yoga, pilates, or meditation over cardio workouts loves cats In our house, we’re a fan of both. Am I a Cat Person or a Dog Person? I would have to say that most, if not all, of the traits above describe me quite well, but with five cats and five dogs, am I so easily categorized? You’ll just have to check out Part Two. This article is a part of Dr. Karyn's series with her five hilarious cats.

My husband loves cats as much as I do, and he fits this description as well. We have 13 cats, all strays and yes they are all fixed. Our Veteran loves us. I like dogs too but never owed one.
