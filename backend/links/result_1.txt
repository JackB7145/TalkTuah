Reactions: Alan Dunn Coily_Thing Member Messages 375 Nov 2, 2024 #2 I Don't really see a competition. There are some similarities in that they both started performing very young and they write and perform "pop music". Sabrina is more overtly sexual in her writing lately. Taylor Swift has long been supportive of younger female pop artists. There were many that opened for her during the last tour and reaped the benefits of the exposure.

Click to expand... Is there really much in common, beyond both working under the broad definition of pop music? Not to my ears. Carpenter has more in common with Olivia Rodrigo than Swift, imho, and even there, the differences are substantial.

The more musicians, the more song writers, the more kids growing up aiming for the lights, the better for you. Because no-dam-body under 50 came to see you playing another tired-arse cover of Brown Eyed Girl. They came to see you because Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter have been continuously inspiring people to learn to play and write music. And to want to see live music.

Taylor on the other hand...... The fact that you asked this question means you've not been paying attention.

Both are putting out middle of the road, average, lowest common denominator kind of pop music that is designed to be easily digestible and disposable.

Sabrina is a bit more overtly sexual with her lyrics and she is more into the lush, kinda dreamy 80s style production. Her voice is also a lot more soft and intimate, which fits nice for the stuff she does. Her sound is definitely more ear candy'ish right now, lots of very catchy stuff. Taylor is kinda minimalistic right now, with more introspective doomer lyrics, the second half of her new album has alot of acoustic stuff like she did on Folklore. To me, Taylor has a bit of a stronger voice that is able to carry her through the more high energy ''epic'' moments.

Swift, for example, has sold more guitars to new players than anyone you could name who’s been relevant in 50 years. And You are welcome to believe music stopped after high school if you choose.

Not really. I didn't complain or say it was bad. That's just how the music business is. I don't hear anything majorly different that leads me to believe one of those ladies is much more talented than the other. Same as Katy Perry or anyone else you could name. Reactions: 5150Eddie , gazfrome , Bob Pollock and 2 others T tracyk Member Messages 1,584 Nov 2, 2024 #18 I'm in the early stages of trying to learn about the music that normal people listen to, but so far I hear almost no similarities between these 2. Reactions: Okkim , Ayns , Herschel and 2 others B Beauchamp Member Messages 286 Nov 2, 2024 #19 Well Taylor writes her own songs which is a big plus in her favor among newer female singers. I don't know if Sabrina does, don't know a whole lot about her. Oh, and Grandpa Simpson looks a lot smarter everyday.

Click to expand... sure, to people who want to be rich, successful and popular like her. Not that I was that different when I started playing. The music is more a not so important detail, catchy pop full of clichès and always the same progressions and very little creativity that is catchy because it can't be more basic than it is. Sure, there are worse things than Shake it off or Espresso, I mean those are kind of nice when you're ok with inoffensive background music with not a lot of substance. Killing Floor said: You are welcome to believe music stopped after high school if you choose. Click to expand... I'm not sure why I'm supposed to believe that just because I think that it's likely that a big part of people into that very basic music are into that for reasons that have little to do with music and lot to do with look, success, money etc. And I love pop music, when it's done well.
