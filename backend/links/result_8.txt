Donâ€™t hate me but Taylor gets too much fame. Taylor is way more popular than people like Shawn Mendes who are WAY better than her, she just has catchy songs. 4 Likes TheForestFrog November 12, 2024, 9:37pm 7 Totally agree. One of my friends said she doesnâ€™t like Taylor Swift and then a 3rd grader told her that she hated her just because she doesnâ€™t like Taylor. If that makes sense No hate to Taylor or her fans 4 Likes KobraRain November 12, 2024, 9:39pm 8 Frr and imo most of her songs sound pretty much the same. I know all singers have their own style but thereâ€™s a difference between a style and the songs just sounding the same lol (I hope I havenâ€™t started a whole argument because if it does I am so sorry) 4 Likes KobraRain November 12, 2024, 9:40pm 9 Omg sometimes things can get a bit crazy when it comes to t swift 4 Likes TheForestFrog November 12, 2024, 9:41pm 10 Yes! You shouldnâ€™t hate someone just because they donâ€™t like the same singer. I love â€˜But Daddy I Love Himâ€™, but just because I donâ€™t consider myself a Swiftie she rolls her eyes at me constantly. Sheâ€™s kind of a brat though 5 Likes KobraRain November 12, 2024, 9:43pm 11 EXACTLY! Not everyone has to have the same taste in music, like I donâ€™t like my mums taste in music but I donâ€™t hate her because of it. By the way if your friend is being a turd you should leave her because you donâ€™t deserve to be treated like that <3 3 Likes CrochetedSparkles14 November 12, 2024, 9:44pm 12 I agree with you all. Iâ€™m not a Swiftie I do like some of her songs but Iâ€™m not obsessed with her like some of my friends. I loooooove Sabrina Carpenter though 3 Likes TheForestFrog November 12, 2024, 9:44pm 13 Sheâ€™s not really my friend (sheâ€™s a 3rd grader ) but yeah, I avoid her. 2 Likes TheForestFrog November 12, 2024, 9:44pm 14 I just like Espresso, thatâ€™s it 3 Likes KobraRain November 12, 2024, 9:45pm 15 Okay well thatâ€™s good I think haha. If you donâ€™t mind me asking how much older/younger are you? 4 Likes KobraRain November 12, 2024, 9:45pm 16 I havenâ€™t listened to her whole short and sweet album but from the snippets Iâ€™ve heard theyâ€™re pretty good and so catchy haha 3 Likes TheForestFrog November 12, 2024, 9:46pm 17 Yeah, I hear them in shorts. I donâ€™t really want to share my age but iâ€™m a teen. I donâ€™t think my parents would want me to. 3 Likes TheForestFrog November 12, 2024, 9:47pm 18 Similar to your age and @CrochetedSparkles14 age. 3 Likes KobraRain November 12, 2024, 9:47pm 19 Ahh okay :) 5 Likes CrochetingKiwi November 12, 2024, 9:48pm 20 random but I LOVE your hair!! @KobraRain 5 Likes next page â†’ Home Spaces Guidelines Terms of Service Privacy Policy Powered by Discourse , best viewed with JavaScript enabled
